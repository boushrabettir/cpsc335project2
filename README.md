- Boushra Bettir (boushra.bettir04@csu.fullerton.edu)

## Project Details

We have two algorithms for pathfinding. The two are **Exhaustive Search** and **Dynamic Programming**.

## Files

- `main.cpp` has all of the code that will run both of the algorithms.
- `README.md` has the explanation to understand the code and to run it.
- `execution.txt` is for saving the scatter plots.

## Running this Project

### ! Before You Continue, please ensure you have a C++ compiler installed to your system. Without it you WILL NOT be able to run the project !

To run the code,

1. Clone the Repo using `git clone [LINK_TO_THIS_REPO]`
2. Do `cd [LINK_TO_CLONED_REPO]`
3. Compile it by doing `g++ -o main main.cpp` (If that does not work run it by doing `g++ -std=c++11 -o main main.cpp`).
4. Run the code by doing `./main`
